I just saved this code for me to use later if I will have to work on a very similar application.

This CNN can be train from dataset which can be downloaded from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=54765
and to use this code save it in main dir folders Datasets/PetImages/Cat Datasets/PetImages/Dog.

Preparation of dataset, training and predicting are implemented.
