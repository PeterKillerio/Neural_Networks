I just saved this code for me to use later if I will have to work on a very similar application.

The function of this LSTM NN is to predict wheter the price will go up or down based on the previous data about the history of crypto
prices whether it is BTC,ETH etc... You can specify how far into the future we want to predict the price, for out example I used 3 future periods. 

It is a rather dumb way to predict crypto prices or any prices. More interesting it would be to combine this model with other models, like the ones for sentiment analysis of twitter, some of the world biggest newspapers, tv channels, online forums/sites, youtube etc. etc. but it is a heck of a lot work to do.

This CNN can be train from dataset which can be downloaded from https://pythonprogramming.net/static/downloads/machine-learning-data/crypto_data.zip
